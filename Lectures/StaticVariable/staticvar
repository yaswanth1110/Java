In Java, static variables are class-level variables shared by all instances of a class. 
A static variable is declared with the static keyword and belongs to the class rather than to any particular object. 
This means that if one instance of the class modifies a static variable, the change is reflected across all instances.

Hereâ€™s how static variables work:

Key Points:
Static variables are shared across all instances: All instances of a class share the same static variable. If one instance modifies it, the change will be visible to all other instances.

Accessing static variables:

They can be accessed directly by the class name (e.g., ClassName.variable).
They can also be accessed via an instance, but this is discouraged as it can be misleading.
Modifying static variables: Any modification to a static variable will affect all instances of the class.
