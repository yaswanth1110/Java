In Java, abstraction is the concept of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. 
It can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

Abstract Class (Animal):
>Cannot be instantiated.
>Contains an abstract method sound() (no body).
>Contains a regular method sleep() with an implementation.

Concrete Subclasses (Dog and Cat):
>These classes must provide an implementation for the abstract method sound().
