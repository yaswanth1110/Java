Java String 

Package: java.lang

Definition: A String is a group of characters represented in double quotes ("").

Characteristics:
String is a final class, meaning it cannot be extended.
String is an immutable class, which means once created, its value cannot be changed. 
This immutability ensures that strings remain constant and helps in memory optimization.

Garbage Collector:
The Garbage Collector is a component of the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) responsible for scanning memory at different intervals and destroying objects that no longer have references attached to them.

String Constant Pool:
A special memory region where Java stores String literals for efficient memory management.
